# PLAN

## Summary

PLAN is a mobile-first web app that serves as a community portal to a connected workspace. In architectural terms, the plan is an imaginary view of a builing's floor as seen from above. In the plan view, one imagines that the building is cut open a few feet above the floor line so that the viewer can see the organization of space at that level. PLAN similarly takes the concept of a building's floor as the organizing principle for the application. Users engage with other people on their floor, creating and viewing community events. Moreover, users would be able to browse events on floors of other buildings if they happen to be in a large complex.
